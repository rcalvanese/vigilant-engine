In order to pre-render a SvelteKit 1.0 static site you need to:

Add to devDependencies in package.json (you can remove the default adapter-auto):
    "@sveltejs/adapter-static": "next",
Run npm install

Add the following line to src/routes/+layout.js - create the file if it does not exist:

    export const prerender = true;
Run npm run build
The static files will be generated in the build directory.
